    "- Detect objects in a car detection dataset\n",
    "- Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy\n",

The video lectures used the latter representation; in this notebook, you'll use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.  \n",

    "- This code uses the convention that (0,0) is the top-left corner of an image, (1,0) is the upper-right corner, and (1,1) is the lower-right corner. In other words, the (0,0) origin starts at the top left corner of the image. As x increases, you move to the right.  As y increases, you move down.\n",
    "- For this exercise, a box is defined using its two corners: upper left $(x_1, y_1)$ and lower right $(x_2,y_2)$, instead of using the midpoint, height and width. This makes it a bit easier to calculate the intersection.\n",
    "- To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply its height $(y_2 - y_1)$ by its width $(x_2 - x_1)$. Since $(x_1,y_1)$ is the top left and $x_2,y_2$ are the bottom right, these differences should be non-negative.\n",
    "- To find the **intersection** of the two boxes $(xi_{1}, yi_{1}, xi_{2}, yi_{2})$: \n",
    "    - Feel free to draw some examples on paper to clarify this conceptually.\n",
    "    - The top left corner of the intersection $(xi_{1}, yi_{1})$ is found by comparing the top left corners $(x_1, y_1)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex that has an x-coordinate that is closer to the right, and y-coordinate that is closer to the bottom.\n",
    "    - The bottom right corner of the intersection $(xi_{2}, yi_{2})$ is found by comparing the bottom right corners $(x_2,y_2)$ of the two boxes and finding a vertex whose x-coordinate is closer to the left, and the y-coordinate that is closer to the top.\n",
    "    - The two boxes **may have no intersection**.  You can detect this if the intersection coordinates you calculate end up being the top right and/or bottom left corners of an intersection box.  Another way to think of this is if you calculate the height $(y_2 - y_1)$ or width $(x_2 - x_1)$ and find that at least one of these lengths is negative, then there is no intersection (intersection area is zero).  \n",
    "    - The two boxes may intersect at the **edges or vertices**, in which case the intersection area is still zero.  This happens when either the height or width (or both) of the calculated intersection is zero.\n",

    "    - Each cell in a 19x19 grid over the input image gives 425 numbers. \n",

    "    - 85 = 5 + 80 where 5 is because $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ has 5 numbers, and 80 is the number of classes we'd like to detect\n",

    "- YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate\n",
    "- It runs an input image through a CNN, which outputs a 19x19x5x85 dimensional volume. \n",
    "- The encoding can be seen as a grid where each of the 19x19 cells contains information about 5 boxes.\n",
    "- You filter through all the boxes using non-max suppression. Specifically: \n",
    "    - Score thresholding on the probability of detecting a class to keep only accurate (high probability) boxes\n",
    "    - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxes\n",
    "- Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, previously trained model parameters were used in this exercise. If you wish, you can also try fine-tuning the YOLO model with your own dataset, though this would be a fairly non-trivial exercise. "
